As coffee shops are plentiful and have low start up costs the businessman wants to open the coffee shop in an area that doesnt have a high density of beloved coffee shops. The businessman would also prefer to place the shop in a neighborhood with a growing population of adults in the age bracket 18 - 45 as the businessman believes this group is most likely to have a higher percentage of spending money and more interested in exploring high quality coffee."
